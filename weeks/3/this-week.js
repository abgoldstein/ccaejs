// Exercise 3.1 - Functions
// Exercise 3.1.1 - Write a sum function. It should take an array of numbers and return the sum of them.


// Exercise 3.1.2 - What is the default return value of a function? Write some code to demonstrate your answer.


// Exercise 3.1.3 - Write the Caesar Cipher encrypt function.
// A Caesar cipher is a very basic style of encryption where all letters are shifted by a number of letters.
// For example, if the phrase is "Dog" and the cipher is 2, the encrypted message becomes "Fqi" because D->E->F, o->p->q, and g->h->i.
// Ask the user for a sentence and a cipher, then use your encrypting function and display your results.

// I have excluded a bunch of information here. You'll probably need an ASCII chart, a way to get substrings, and to count characters.
// Try using the internet to fill in your missing toolset. I can help you if you get stuck.
function decrypt() {

function encrypt() {

}

// Exercises 3.1.4 - Write the Caesar Cipher decrypt function.
// Write a function to take an encrypted message and decrypt it with a given cipher. Show the user the decrypted message.


// Exercise 3.1.5 - Test it! Try encrypting a string and then sending it to a neighbor for decryption. How do you do?
